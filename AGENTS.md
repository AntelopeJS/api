# api

The HTTP and WebSocket server module of AntelopeJS, published as `@antelopejs/api`. It implements `@antelopejs/interface-api` and `@antelopejs/interface-api-util` (`antelopeJs.implements` in `package.json`) on the Node.js `http`, `https` and `ws` servers.

## Layout

- `src/index.ts` is the module entry (`provide`, `construct`, `start`, `stop`, `destroy`); `src/implementations/api` binds the interface-api proxies, and `src/middlewares/cors.ts` holds CORS.
- `src/config-vars.ts` compiles to `dist/config-vars.js`, which `antelopeJs.configVarsFile` names. Tools load it by path without starting the project to resolve `${@api.API_PORT}`, `${@api.API_LOCAL_BASE_URL}` and `${@api.API_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}`, so keep it a pure function of the module config. Renaming a config var, or the `configVarsFile` entry, is a breaking change.
- `playground/` is a pnpm workspace package: a project that loads this module from `..`. It is not part of the published package.

## Versioning

- The startup gate relies on `Events.ModulesStarted`, which only `@antelopejs/core` 1.17.0 and later emit, so the `@antelopejs/core` peer range stays `>=1.17.0 <2`, and `@antelopejs/interface-core` stays at `>=0.2.6`.
- A change users must act on, such as a raised core or interface minimum, gets an `### Upgrade notes` section in `CHANGELOG.md`, added after the release in a `docs(changelog)` commit (see #71 and #74).

## Tests

- The suites live in `src/test` and compile with the package. `pnpm test` builds `dist` once, then `ajs module test .` (from the `@antelopejs/core` devDependency) loads `src/test/antelope.test.ts`, the `antelopeJs.test` config, which runs `dist/test` against a server on `127.0.0.1:5010`. That port must be free. `pnpm run checks` runs them.
- `pnpm run checks` does not run the playground. Run it with `pnpm dev` (`ajs project run -w -p playground`); it also serves on port 5010.

## Guardrails

Finish every change with `pnpm run checks`. It runs typecheck, lint, format, knip, tests, size, ratchet, suppressions, and sync, and prints only what failed. The change is done when it prints no failure.

The tools enforce most rules, listed in the table at the end. The sections below hold the rules no tool checks.

### Comments

Say it in code. A constraint belongs in a type, a lint rule, or a test. A public item's contract belongs in TSDoc (`/** */`) on that item. The only other comments are lint directives that name their rules, `@ts-expect-error <reason>`, `SAFETY: <reason>` above a type assertion, `/*!` license headers, and bundler or formatter directives.

Before suppressing a type rule, try inference or a type derived from its owner with `Parameters`, `ReturnType`, or indexed access. A private alias can still appear in a published declaration. Keep a suppression only after checking the published contract and the unchecked boundary it protects.

Check each directive reason against the current line and its callers. Returning a value is not the same as awaiting and discarding it. A reason must describe what the code does now.

### Tests

Hold every test you write or keep to this checklist:

- Name the wrong implementation this test fails on. A test with no answer is deleted, not kept.
- No test reads the file it tests. Drive the behaviour through the public interface.
- An invariant over many files is a lint rule, not a test.

### Cleanup proof

A behaviour-preserving cleanup PR shows `antelopejs-api-diff <base-ref>` passing. Published declarations and built runtime exports stay unchanged; pass `--allow-added <glob>` (repeatable, e.g. `'**/internal/**'`) to let added entries under that glob pass when their module is `@internal`, and copy its "Added (allowed)" list. A comment-only PR shows `antelopejs-comment-proof <base-ref>` passing instead of a verifier. Both compare committed HEAD.

Copy counts from the proof's base and HEAD table. Never type counts by hand. Keep the command and the committed head beside the copied output. The table counts a lint directive once per rule it names, inline directives included.

Pass `--probe <file.cjs>` to api-diff when changing receivers, positional calls, or modules that no published entry reaches. The same captured script runs against both worktree roots, supplied as `argv[2]`, and prints JSON observations. Matching metadata alone does not prove those behaviours.

An entry-only rule exempts only its own module. Add a second module entry rather than exempting another importer. A no-upward rule must reject peers in the same tier as well as higher tiers. Probe the rank decision with an import, not just a reading of the configuration.

Moving a method body into a function keeps how it is called: the same receiver, argument count, read order and laziness.

Verify a boundary against the imports a developer or agent would plausibly write: static and dynamic imports, re-exports, Vue `src`, CSS `@import`, and worker or child-process entries in normally named files. A construction only an evasion would write, an edit to resolution configuration (`package.json` `browser`, `exports`, `main` or `imports`, bundler aliases, tsconfig `paths`), and a difference observable only by patching private fields or internal methods go under Attention and never block. Public API and ordinary subclass behaviour stay part of the contract.

### Suppression budget

`guardrails.suppressions.json` caps the suppressions in authored code: lint directives per rule they name (`*` for none), `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-ignore` and `SAFETY:` comments. A suppression over its ceiling fails: fix the code, or remove another suppression of the same kind. A rule that keeps needing suppressions should be changed in the preset. Never raise or remove a number in that file: the check fails a ceiling higher than on the pull request base, and only the operator approves a raise. A directive disabling `anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` is burn-down debt: remove the assertion, or, where it holds, replace the directive with `SAFETY: <why it holds>`, which takes over its room without a raise. After you remove suppressions, run `pnpm run suppressions:update` and commit the lowered file.

### Debt

`guardrails.ratchet.json` records the lint findings and oversize files this repository already had. Its numbers only go down. After you remove debt, run `pnpm run ratchet:update` and commit the lowered file. A rule listed there is off for `oxlint`. The ratchet counts it instead, and the pre-commit hook rejects it on every line you add.
